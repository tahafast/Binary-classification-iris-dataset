# Binary-classification-iris-dataset
I have made this binary classifier for iris dataset while importing it from scikit learn machine learning library while implementing gradient descent and plotting decision boundaries, splitting the data into using training and testing sets and further applied a single layer perceptron causing it to be a shallow model.
